A Complete fully open-sourced iOS 12.0 - 12.5.5 jailbreak. 
 - haven't tested this on ios 12.1.2 yet but i will in a later date.
 - tested on iOS 12.4 - 12.5.5 iPhone 5s & iPhone 6+.
 - todo ( try and patch amfi to get out my way) - current method involves injecting everything to trustcache, ugh. - complete... no more injecting of the whole bootstrap into trustcache
 - vigorous testing for remount failures and issues cause by a bad inital remount and or restorerootfs. Fixed hopefully, currently testing again and again for the bug ðŸª²... 
 - AMFID destroyed! last step is to figure out how to get my amfid patch running fully from the first inital bootstrapping process. Otherwise amfid patch works perfectly fine after. bootstrapping and rebooting one time initally.
 - Fixed remount issues, no further bugs found or reported.
 - New jailbreakd, pspawn_payload & amfid_payload.
