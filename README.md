# Th0r_Freya

A Complete fully open-sourced iOS 12.0 - 12.5.6 jailbreak. 
 
 - tested on iOS 12.1.2, 12.1.3, 12.1.4, 12.2, 12.3, 12.3.1, 12.4, 12.4.4(iirc) and of course 12.5.5 & 12.5.6, between my iPhone 5s & iPhone 6 & 6+.
 - AMFID destroyed! 
 - await further bugs found or reported.
 - New jailbreakd, pspawn_payload & amfid_payload.
 - Freya comes wih its own tweak injector. No other tweak injector is compatible atm. (DO NOT INSTALL SUBSTITUTE/SUBSTRATE/LIBHOOKER) It will break your jailbreak
 - Freya works with cydia and probably Zebra. Not compatible with Sileo package manager.
 
 
 Known Issues -
 
    1. App exploit failed = reboot, try again. wait a min if you're not having luck after 2 attempts.
    2. System mount update file detected = some latest ios devices are experiencing this issue and not able to remount the file system. Restore device with an ipsw (recommended).
    3. Cydia installed but not visible = a preference in springboard isn't sticking. reboot device and try again. (I've now added a tweak that should fix this issue while installing bootstrap).
