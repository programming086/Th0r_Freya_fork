A Complete iOS 12.0 - 12.5.5 jailbreak. 
 - haven't tested this on ios 12.1.2 yet but i will in a later date.
 - tested on iOS 12.5.5 iPhone 5s
 - todo ( try and patch amfi to get out my way) - current method involves injecting everything to trustcache, ugh.
 - vigorous testing for remount failures and issues cause by a bad inital remount and or restorerootfs. Fixed hopefully, currently testing again and again for the bug ðŸª²...
